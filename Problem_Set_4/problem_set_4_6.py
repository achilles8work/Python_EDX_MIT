Problem 6 - Playing a Game
0.0/15.0 points (graded)
A game consists of playing multiple hands. We need to implement one final function to complete our word-game program. Write the code that implements the playGame function. You should remove the code that is currently uncommented in the playGame body. Read through the specification and make sure you understand what this function accomplishes. For the game, you should use the HAND_SIZE constant to determine the number of cards in a hand.

Testing: Try out this implementation as if you were playing the game. Try out different values for HAND_SIZE with your program, and be sure that you can play the wordgame with different hand sizes by modifying only the variable HAND_SIZE.

Sample Output
Here is how the game output should look...
